PROBLEM:-
        Get three exam grades from the user and compute the average of the grades. Output the average of the three exams.Together with the average ,also include a smiley face in the output if the average is greater than or equal to 70.

ANALYSIS:-
    INPUT:-
        Input 3 subjects marks by user.
        For example :- Mathematices - 75
                       Science - 65
                       Chemistry - 70
    PROCESS:-
        -> sum=sub1+sub2+sub3; (Here sub1 is Mathematices, sub2 is Science and sub3 is Chemistry. sum is summation of sub1,sub2 and sub3)
        -> avg=sum/3;   (Here avg is Average and Average of formula is No.Of elements is divided by addition of all elements)
    OUTPUT:-
        -> if(avg >= 70)
            Outcome will be smiley face(emoji).
           else
            The average of 3 subjects(exams)

ALGORITHM:-
    Step 1:- Start
    Step 2:- Input 3 numbers
    Step 3:- sum=0
    Step 4:- sum=sub1+sub2+sub3
    Step 5:- avg=sum/3
    Step 6:- if(avg >= 70)
                print smiley face
            else
                print average
    Step 7:- End
