PROBLEM :- Write a Java program to get a number from the user and print whether it is positive or negative.
            Input a: 1
            Input b: 5
            Input c: 1
            Expected Output :
            The roots are -0.20871215252208009 and -4.7912878474779195
            
ANALYSIS :- 
    INPUT :- Input 3 double numbers from user. i.e. a,b and c.

    PROCESS :- Initialiazation a res double variable. a,b and c use in Quadratic Equations. 
               i.e double res = (b * b) - (4.0 * a * c);

               if result is positive number it is the equation has varies two roots i.e. 
               first is double res1=(-b + Math.pow(result, 0.5)) / (2.0 * a);
               second is double res2=(-b - Math.pow(result, 0.5)) / (2.0 * a);

               if result is equal to zero then the equation has root is double res = -b / (2.0 * a);

               Otherwise The equation has no real roots.

    OUTPUT :- print root/roots value.

ALGORITHM :- 
    STEP 1 :- Start
    STEP 2 :- Initialiazation 6 double variables is a,b,c,res,res1 and res2.
    STEP 3 :- res=(b * b) - (4.0 * a * c);
    STEP 4 :- if (res > 0)
                res1=(-b + Math.pow(result, 0.5)) / (2.0 * a);
                res2=(-b - Math.pow(result, 0.5)) / (2.0 * a);
                print res1 and res2.
              else if (res==0)
                res = -b / (2.0 * a);
                print res.
              else 
                print statement is The equation has no real roots.
    STEP 5 :- End
