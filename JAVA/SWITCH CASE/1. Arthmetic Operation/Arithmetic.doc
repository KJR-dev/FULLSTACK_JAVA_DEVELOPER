PROBLEM:-
    WAP to perform arithmetic operation on two number based on users choice.

ANALYSIS:-
    INPUT:- Input two number and choice. Here choice is opertion, what kind of operation between two numbers you want.
            (n=number and c=choice)

    PROCESS:- User choice is + then addition of two numbers will be process.
              User choice is - then subtraction of two numbers will be process.
              User choice is * then multiplication of two numbers will be process.
              User choice is / then division of two numbers will be process.
              User choice is % then remainder of two numbers will be process.
              finally arithmetic process value assigned in r. Here r=result.
    
    OUTPUT:- Print r value.

ALGORITHIM:- 
    STEP 1:- Start
    STEP 2:- Input two numbers
    STEP 3:- Choose a Arthimethic operation
    STEP 4:- Arthimetic operation compare with every CASE. Which Arthimethic operation match with CASE that CASE statement exicute.

    STEP 5:- If Arthimethic operation does not match any CASE statement then program go to default statement and exicute default statement.

    STEP 6:- End
